    <string name="welcome_home">Scoring the Bowling game needs the players to revisit the
        previous shots in order to re-calculate the scores. This might become
        cumbersome when done on papers because the logic is somehow complex.
        Usually at the Bowling location, the software shows on screen the effect
        of every new shot on scoring.</string>
